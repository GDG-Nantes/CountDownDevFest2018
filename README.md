## How to contribute (where is F...ing code!?)

The VueJS application is in `/src` directory. The vue app is a single page application that switch the user between the game `/` (Attendee interaction) and the countdown `/countdown` (the main screen).
The `public` directory contains a webworker where all the logic of planet manipulation runs.
The `functions` directory contains an endpoint. For the moment useless (I will maybe drop it).
